# Self-Balancing-Bike
Build a Self Balancing Bike to balance on two wheels, tuned with PID and used the Sensor Fusion data between the data coming from the encoder (of the front wheel) and the data from IMU sensor using Complementary Filter and move the bike to the targeted location by changing its set point.
